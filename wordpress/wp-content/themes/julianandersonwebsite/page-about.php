<h2>Understanding What I Do</h2>
<p>I started developing websites in 2017. I have a basic knowledge in Java before and I love programming. I started
    learning web development from Udemy Courses. It is not easy at first but I managed to figure things out. Doing
    web development has been fun for me. I finally found something I love in the last year of college. Even though
    I am not majoring in Computer Science, I love doing this. I love to learn new things to improve myself as a web
    developer. At the end of the day, hard work pays off. I can finally have a client work after a couple of months.
    I’m happy doing web development and helping others to grow as a business through the thing I build for them.</p>
